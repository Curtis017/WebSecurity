This program implements the very basic components of an HTTP 1.1 client.
It takes two command line arguments one for the method and one for the
page url which must begin with "http://" or "https://".

Implementation includes all methods available in HTTP 1.1. However, based
on the assignment writeup, only the basic operations are fully supported.
(i.e. no additional headers or body information can be included within the HTTP request)
Therefore methods such as POST and PUT are fairly useless. The client also supports
chunked data responses by retrieving data in clumps of 1024 bytes at a time.

If the status of the response is in the 2XX level then the output of the program
is the body of the HTTP response and will exit in a return value of 0. Responses in
the 3XX level will be redirected up to five times before the program will exit in a
return value of '3'.  All exit values include:
    0 - 2XX level response
    3 - 3XX level response (after 5 redirect attempts)
    4 - 4XX level response
    5 - 5XX level response
    1 - All other response levels

The Makefile is only supplied because it was required by the project writeup. All it does is
change the permissions of the client file.


Example Usage:
"./client GET http://www.google.com"
