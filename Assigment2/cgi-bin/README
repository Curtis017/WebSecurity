As requested in email the executable name is in the format "net-id_hw2.cgi"

This program is a web application that will return two web pages:
  1. cgi-bin/jhughe39_hw2/calculator
  2. cgi-bin/jhughe39_hw2/guestbook

Calculator - will take two floating point numbers and an operator and return
the calculated value of the two numbers based on the provided operator.

Guestbook - will keep a list of guest that have been added to the server.  The
list is stored in a file on the server side.

Makefile - will change the permissions on the jhughe39_hw2.cgi executable and remove any file
named guestbook from the parent directory and replace it with a new file named
guestbook.

**** Program must be ran inside of a cgi enabled server running from the cgi-bin directory ****
